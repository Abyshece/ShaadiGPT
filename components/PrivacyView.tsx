          This Privacy Policy explains how ShaadiGPT ("we", "us", or "the Service") collects, uses,
          stores, and protects your personal information when you use our dating and matrimony
          platform. We are committed to handling your data with care and in accordance with the
          EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), India's Digital Personal Data Protection
          Act, and other applicable laws.
        </p>

        <Section title="1. Who we are">
          <p>
            ShaadiGPT is operated by Abhishek (the "Operator"). For any privacy-related questions,
            you can contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@shaadigpt.com" className="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 underline">privacy@shaadigpt.com</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are the data controller for the personal information you provide on this platform.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="2. What information we collect">
          <p>We collect the following categories of personal data:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2">
            <li><strong>Account data:</strong> email address, password (hashed), date of registration</li>
            <li><strong>Profile data:</strong> name, age, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, religion, languages, location, hometown, photos, bio, and roughly 80 other optional profile attributes you choose to share (lifestyle, personality, relationship preferences, etc.)</li>
            <li><strong>Activity data:</strong> likes you send and receive, matches, messages, search queries, login history</li>
            <li><strong>Technical data:</strong> IP address, browser type, device information, cookies (see Section 8)</li>
            <li><strong>Payment data:</strong> if you upgrade to Pro, payment is processed by Razorpay; we never see your card details. We retain only the Razorpay subscription ID and transaction status.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-2">
            Some categories — religion, sexuality, ethnicity, health-related fields — are considered
            "special category" data under GDPR. We process this only because you have given explicit
            consent by entering it into your profile, and only for the matchmaking purpose.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="3. Why we process your data">
          <p>We use your data for:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2">
            <li>Creating your account and providing the matchmaking service</li>
            <li>Showing relevant profiles to you and your profile to relevant others</li>
            <li>Enabling chat between matched users</li>
            <li>Verifying account identity to prevent fraud and abuse</li>
            <li>Processing subscription payments (Pro tier)</li>
            <li>Sending essential service emails (account verification, security alerts)</li>
            <li>Sending optional notifications (new matches, likes) — only if you opt in</li>
            <li>Investigating reports and enforcing community guidelines</li>
            <li>Complying with legal obligations</li>
          </ul>
        </Section>

        <Section title="4. Legal basis for processing">
          <p>Under GDPR, we process your data on the following legal bases:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2">
            <li><strong>Contract:</strong> processing required to deliver the service you signed up for</li>
            <li><strong>Consent:</strong> for special-category data (religion, sexuality, etc.), marketing emails, and optional cookies</li>
            <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> security, fraud prevention, and basic analytics</li>
            <li><strong>Legal obligation:</strong> where required by law (e.g., responding to legal requests)</li>
          </ul>
        </Section>

        <Section title="5. How we share your data">
          <p>We share data with the following categories of recipients:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2">
            <li><strong>Other users:</strong> your profile (excluding fields you mark hidden) is visible to other users in search results and matches</li>
            <li><strong>Supabase (database & auth):</strong> our backend hosting provider, EU/US infrastructure</li>
            <li><strong>Vercel (web hosting):</strong> hosts the website and serves it from edge locations worldwide</li>
            <li><strong>Razorpay (payments):</strong> processes Pro subscription payments, based in India</li>
            <li><strong>Resend (email):</strong> sends transactional emails — when configured with a real domain</li>
            <li><strong>Law enforcement:</strong> only when legally compelled (court order, subpoena)</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-2">
            We <strong>do not sell</strong> your personal data to anyone, ever. We do not run ads

          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="6. International data transfers">
          <p>
            Some of our service providers (Vercel, Supabase) operate globally and may transfer your
            data outside the European Economic Area. When this happens, we rely on Standard
            Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission, or the recipient country's
            adequacy decision, to ensure your data is protected.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="7. How long we keep your data">
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2">
            <li><strong>Active account:</strong> as long as you use the service</li>
            <li><strong>Deleted account:</strong> within 30 days of deletion request. Some records (transactions, fraud-prevention logs) may be retained for up to 7 years where legally required.</li>
            <li><strong>Consent records:</strong> for the duration of our legal obligation to demonstrate compliance (typically 6 years)</li>
            <li><strong>Backups:</strong> regularly overwritten; deleted data is gone within 30 days even from backups</li>
          </ul>
        </Section>

        <Section title="8. Cookies and tracking">
          <p>We use cookies and similar technologies for:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-2">
            <li><strong>Essential (always on):</strong> keeping you logged in, security tokens, basic functionality</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics (optional):</strong> understanding how the service is used to improve it — disabled by default until you consent</li>
            <li><strong>Marketing (optional):</strong> currently unused, but reserved for future promotional features — disabled by default</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-2">

          </ul>

        </Section>

        <Section title="10. Security">
          <p>
            We protect your data with industry-standard security measures including encrypted
            transit (HTTPS/TLS), encrypted storage at rest, row-level security policies on the
            database, and access controls limiting which engineers can view production data.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, no system is 100% secure. If we ever experience a data breach affecting your
            personal data, we will notify you and the relevant authorities within 72 hours, as
            required by GDPR.
          </p>
